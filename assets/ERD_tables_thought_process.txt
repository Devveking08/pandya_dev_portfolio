Relationships:


User to About Section (1-to-1):

This means that for each user on your website, there's only one corresponding "About" section, and vice versa. It's a one-to-one relationship, like each person having a unique ID card.

About Section to Download Resume Button (1-to-1):

In the "About" section, there's just one "Download Resume" button, and this button belongs only to that specific "About" section. It's also a one-to-one relationship, like one key fitting into one lock.

User to Projects (1-to-many):

Each user can have multiple projects associated with them, but each project is linked to only one user. Think of it like a user being a book author, and the books they write are the projects. One author can have many books, but each book belongs to only one author.

User to Case Studies (1-to-many):

Similar to the "Projects" relationship, each user can have multiple case studies, and each case study is linked to one user. It's like a chef who can have many recipes, but each recipe is authored by only one chef.

User to Email & Feedback (1-to-1):

Each user can have one "Email & Feedback" section, and that section is exclusive to that user. It's a one-to-one relationship, like one phone number corresponding to one person.
